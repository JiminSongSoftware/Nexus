# Welcome to Nexus! üöÄüå©Ô∏èüë®‚Äçüíª

Demo: https://www.nexus-dashboard.software/

## Inspiration

We were inspired to create Nexus because we noticed a lack of user-friendly cloud storage dashboards that could effectively visualize the contents of different cloud storage providers. We wanted to create a platform that could provide real-time monitoring and support for multiple cloud storage providers while also ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive data.

## What it does

Nexus is a dashboard for managing cloud storage environments, such as Google Drive, OneDrive, and Dropbox. It provides a unified view of your content across multiple cloud storage providers, an easy-to-use interface for managing and organizing cloud storage resources, and robust security features to ensure the privacy and security of sensitive data.

### Functions ‚öíÔ∏è

- üìä Real-time monitoring and visualization of cloud storage usage metrics
- üåê Support for multiple cloud storage providers
- üíª Easy-to-use interface for managing and organizing cloud storage resources
- üîí Robust security features to ensure the privacy and security of sensitive data.

## How we built it

We built Nexus using a combination of Angular on the frontend, REST APIs on the backend, and Sass (or Less) for CSS preprocessing. We used Angular Material to provide a modern and responsive UI, and we integrated the backend with different cloud storage providers using their APIs. We also prioritized security throughout the development process, implementing robust measures to protect sensitive data.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the main challenges we faced was integrating the APIs of different cloud storage providers, which required significant research and experimentation to get right. We also had to deal with complex data structures and large datasets, which posed additional challenges in terms of performance and scalability.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of creating a dashboard that provides a user-friendly and secure way to manage cloud storage resources across multiple providers. We're also proud of the technical achievements we made in terms of integrating multiple cloud storage providers and creating a responsive and intuitive UI.

## What's next for Nexus

In the future, we plan to add support for more cloud storage providers and additional features to further enhance the usability and functionality of Nexus. We also plan to continue improving the security of the platform and staying up-to-date with the latest best practices in cloud storage and web application development.
